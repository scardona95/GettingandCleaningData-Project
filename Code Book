Code Book


The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition.

# Download the dataset & unzip
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

#1.Reading the data 

Assign each data to variables

features <- features.txt - List of all features

activities <- activity_labels.txt - Links the class labels with their activity name

subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt - contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

x_test <- test/X_test.txt - Test set

y_test <- test/y_test.txt - Test labels

subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt - contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

x_train <- test/X_train.txt  - Training set

y_train <- test/y_train.txt - Training labels

#Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

data_x is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
data_y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
data_s is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
all_data is created by merging data_s, data_y and data_x using cbind() function

#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

DataMeanandStd is created by subsetting all_data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Entire numbers in code column of the DataMeanandStd replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
code column in DataMeanandStd renamed into activities

All Acc in column's name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column's name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column's name replaced by Body
All Mag in column's name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column's name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column's name replaced by Time

#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

TidySet is created by sumarizing DataMeanandStd taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export TidySet into TidySet.txt file.
